                    NUMBERS

Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types, which means that changing the value of a number data type results in a newli allocated object.

Python supports differient numerical types:
    Integers, that have no franctional part:  e.g. 123, 5
    Floating point numbers, that have a fractional part:  e.g. 3.14, 3.333333, 2.5*10 [squared]
    Complex numbers, that have imaginary parts:  e.g. 1 + 2j


                  NUMBER OPERATIONS

Operations          Interpretations
x or y              Logical OR (y is evaluated only if x is false)
x and y             Logical AND (y is evaluated only if x is true)
not x               Logical negation
x is y, x is not y  Object identy test
x<y,x<=y,x>y,x>=y   Magnitude comparison
x == y, x !+ y      Value equality operators
x | y               Bitwise OR
X ^ y               Bitwise XOR
x & y               Bitwise AND
x<<y, x>>y          Shift x left or right by y bits
x + y               Addition
x - y               Subtraction
x * y               Multiplication
y % x               Remainder
y / x               Division
-x, +x              Negation, identity
~x                  Bitwise NOT 
x ** y              Power
