                    OPERATOR OVERLOADING

Operator overloading allows same operator to have differient meaning according to the context.

                Example of overloading '+' operator
                    1+2     # sum
                3
                    'sun' +'set'    # concatenation
                'sunset'

We can also overload the built-in operators to make them work as we want. Python provides
special methods for that. Example: addition, slicing, printing, and so on.   



        Main Ideas of operator overloading

Methods named with double underscors (__X__) are special hooks.
Such methods are called automatically when instances appear in built in operations.
Classes may override most built in type operations.
There are no defaults for operator overloading methods, and none are required.
Operatore allow classes to integrate with python's object model.




        OPERATOR OVERLOADING METHODS

Method              Implements              Called for
__init__            Constructor             Object creation:X=class_name(args)
__add__             Operator +              X+Y,X+=Y
__or__              Operator | (bitwise or) X|Y,X|=Y 
__repr__,__str__    printing                Print(X),repr(X),str(X)
__getattr__         Attribute fetch         X.any
__setattr__         Attribute assignment    X.any = value
__delattr__         Attribute delition      de X.any
__len_              length                  len(X)
__lt__,__get__      Comparisons             X<Y,X>Y
__bool__            Boolean tests           boll(X)
__contains__        Membership tests        Item in X(any iterable)




        SCOPE IN Python

# file scope.py
X= 11       # Global name               	print X         #11.module
def f():                                	f()             #11:global
    print X  # Access local             	g()             #22:local
def g():									print X			# 11:module
	x = 22	# local variable 				obj = C()		#make instance
	print X									print obj.X		# 33:class name inherited by instance
class C:									obj.m()			# Attach attribute name X to instance
	X = 33	# class attribute				print obj.X		# 55 : instance
	def m(self)								print C.X 		# 33:class 
		x = 44	# local variable in method	# print(C.m.X)  # FAILS:only visiable in method
		self.X = 55 # instance attribute	# print(g.X)	# FAILS:only visible in function
