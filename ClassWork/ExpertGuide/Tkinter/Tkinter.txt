                WHAT IS TKINTER

Tkinter is an open source, portable GUI toolkit designed for use in Python scripts
Actually, Tkinter is simply the name of python's interface to Tk-a GUI library originally written with Tcl programming language.
The CUI calls are internally routed from python script, to Tkinter and back to python script.



                ADVANTAGES OF TKINTER

Accessibility:  Tkinter is reguarded as a lightweight toolkit and one of
                the simplest solutions for python available today.

Portability     A python script that builds GUI with Tkinter will run
                without source code changes on all major platforms.
                The same script will provide the native look and feel to
                it's users on each platforms.

Availability    Tkinter is a standard module in the python library,
                shipped with the interpreter, Therefor, if I have
                python, I have Tkinter.

                            Dimensions
                              Color

                             Bitmaps
                             Cursors




            TKINTER VARIABLES

Variables can be used with most entry widgets to track changes to the entered value.
The Checkbutton and Radiobutton widgets require Varibbles to work properly.
Variables can also be used to validate the contents of an entry widget, and to change the text in lable widgets.
Tkinter provides the Variable (abstract) class.
The Variable class provides the possibility of associating a callback method with a  Variable.
Thus, one could respond to a change in the value of such variables.



                            VARIABLES
                                |
    ____________________________|___________________________
    |               |                   |                   |
StringVar        IntVar            BooleanVar           DoubleVar




            GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT IN TKUNDER

GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT CONSISTS OF WIDGET PLACEMENT AND SIZING OF THE SCREEN.

        Tkinter privides 3 geometry managers.

Pack: Quickest and most common way to design interfaces.
    Positioning is done relative to the container widgets (top, bottom, left, right)

Grid: Used for more complex layouts.
    Allows the container to be ivided in rows and columns:

Place: Most powerful manager.
    Allows placement of widgets using either exact coordinates, or as a percentage relative to the size of the master window.




            EVENT HANDELING

Anything that happens in a user interface is an event- for example, clicks on a button or types on a keyboard.

Some events cauld also be triggered by occurences which are not controlled by the user - for example, a background task might complete, or a network connection might be established or lost. 

Our application needs to monitor, or listen for, all events that we find ihteresting, and respond to them in some way if they occur.

To do this, we usually associate certain functions with particular events. We call a function which performs an action in responce to an event an event handler-we binb handlers to events.

            A SIMPLE PROGRAM 

Creating a GUI application using
Tkinder is an easy task. All you need to
do is perform the following steps.                      from Tkinder import*
                                                        root = Tk()
Import the Tkinter module                               root.title("A simple application")
                                                        root.mainloop()
Create the GUI application main window.

Add one or more  of the widgets to the GUI
application.

Enter the main event loop to take action
against each event triggered by the user.
