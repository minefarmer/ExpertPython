         FILES

Files are named storage compartments on our computer that are managed by the operating system.
Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default

    OPERATIONS                          INTERPRETATION
f = open(name[, mode])              Create a file object
Text = input.read()                 Read entire file into a single string
Text = input.read(N)                Read up to the next N characters into a string
Text = input.readlune()             Read nest line into a string
output.write(text)                  Write a string of characters into a file
output.close()                      Manual close
anyfile.seek(N)                     Change file position to offset N for next operation


    MODES               DESCRIPTION
r               Open a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.
rb              Open a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file'
r+              Opens a file for both reading and writing, The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.
rb+             Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format, The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.       
w               Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist.
wb              Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist.file.
w+              Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the file if the file exists. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist.
wb+             Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist.file.
a               Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists. If a file does not exist, it creates a new file for both reading and writing.
ab              Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists. If a file does not exist, it creates a new file for both reading and writing.
a+              Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists. If a file does not exist, it creates a new file for both reading and writing.
ab+             Opens a file for appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists. If a file does not exist, it creates a new file for both reading and writing.
