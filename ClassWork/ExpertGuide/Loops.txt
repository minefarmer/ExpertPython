        WHILE LOOP

It repeatpy executes a block of (normally indented code) statements as long as a test at the top keeks evaluating to true value.

Control keeps looping back to the start of the statement until the test becimes false.

        FOR LOOP
It can step through the items in any ordered Sequence or other iterable object. The for statement works on strings, lists, tuples, and other built-in iterables, as well as new user-defined objects.

                General format
                for target in object:   # Assign object items to target
        ---->           statements    # Repeated loop body: use target
Indent blocks   else:                   # Optional else part
        ---->           statements    # If I didn't hit a 'Break'
