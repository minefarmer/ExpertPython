INTRODUCTION TO CONDITIONALS

Conditionals are expressions that evaluate to either true or false.

    Why we need contitionals.
    In a program sometimes flow needs to take decisions based on checks and contitions i.e. we want our program to perform a set of actions in case A, but perform another set of actions in case B.
